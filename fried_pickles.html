		<h1>Fried Pickles</h1>
		<p>This recipe works with pickle chips or spear but I much prefer chips as they are easier to prepare and fry and the batter sticks to them better.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
      <li>1 jar hamburger dill pickle chips</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>Cajun seasoning</li>
      <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Hot sauce of your choice. I recommend <a href="https://www.tabasco.com/product/original-red-sauce/">basic Tobasco sauce</a> or <a href="https://www.cholula.com/chili_garlic.html">chili garlic Cholula</a> sauce.</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk (I just eyeballed it)</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour (I just eyeballed it)</li>
      <li>Canola oil (enough to get about 1/2inch in a pan)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
		</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Drain the pickles well. I tossed mine around in paper towels to make sure they were pretty dry</li>
      <li>Mix the flour, cajun spices, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper into a bowl</li>
      <li>Mix the buttermilk, egg, and hot sauce (I probably used about 2tbsp but I like some heat) and whisk together</li>
      <li>Bring oil up to medium or medium-high heat</li>
      <li>Cover the pickles in the flour mixture (make sure to thoroughly cover - this helps the batter to stick)</li>
      <li>Dip into the batter covering both sides</li>
      <li><strong>Safely</strong> dip into the oil (test oil temperature first - if you don't have experience frying things, it can be very dangerous)</li>
      <li>Fry about 45-90 seconds on each side (depending how big the pickle chips are and how crispy you like them)</li>
      <li>Let dry on paper towels or a rack and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Finished product:</p>
