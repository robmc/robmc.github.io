		<p>Much like similar foods, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_goddess_dressing">Green Goddess</a> can be a dressing or a dip. This recipe is a dip and goes well served with raw vegetables and pita chips. I found <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013024-greek-goddess-dip">this recipe on the NY Times site</a> and the comments by people who made it said they wouldn't change a thing. I definitely agree as this is delicious.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place dill, mint, parsley, basil, garlic, scallions, lemon juice, and salt in a food processor and process until finely chopped. When prepping the herbs, you don't have to finely dice or prep them as the food processor will take care of this. Simply remove them from their stems.</li>
      <li>With the motor running, drizzle in the olive oil until incorporated. Add feta and process until smooth. Pulse in the yogurt. Taste the dip and add additional salt to taste, if desired. For creamier, richer dip, add the mayo and pulse to combine.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I did not use mayo when I made this. This made enough for a few servings and there was more left in a tupperware container as it made more than what is in the bowl in the image of the finished plated dish.</p>
    <p>Finished product:</p>
