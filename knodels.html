	<ul>
      <li>4 cups bread or rolls torn apart</li>
      <li>1/4-1/3 cup milk</li>
      <li>1-2 strips of bacon, diced</li>
      <li>1/2 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>Approx. 1/4 cup flour</li>
      <li>Dash of nutmeg</li>
      <li>Salt/pepper to taste</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the torn bread into a large bowl, pour the milk over it evenly, and set aside.</li>
      <li>Fry the bacon in a skillet, remove the grease, and set aside to cool. (I set mine aside on a paper towel to soak some of the grease)</li>
      <li>Sauté the onions in the same pan you cooked the bacon</li>
      <li>Add the parsley, salt/pepper, nutmeg, eggs, and cooled bacon and onions</li>
      <li>Work the mixture together. Use your hands and mix everything in the bowl similar to making a meat loaf.</li>
      <li>Slowly add some flour and continue working the mixture until it is like a sticky dough.</li>
      <li>Form balls of the dough mixture and add them to a pot of lightly salted boiling water.</li>
      <li>The dumplings will rise to the surface a few minutes before they are finished</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I garnished mine with a little bit of fresh chopped parsley. These go great as a side to meat dishes.</p>
