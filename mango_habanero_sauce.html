		<h1>Mango Habanero Hot Sauce</h1>
		</div>
		<p>I mostly followed <a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a47208/mango-habanero-hot-sauce/">this recipe</a> with some minor changes. I like a lot of heat and garlic so I added 8 habaneros and 5 garlic cloves. I also like thick sauces so I didn't add any of the cooking liquid to thin it down. It had heat but surprisingly needed quite a bit of salt with the sweetness of the mango and I added the juice of a whole lime because the lime wasn't that big. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
      <li>8 habanero peppers, destemmed</li>
      <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium white onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped mango</li>
      <li>5 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>Juice of 1 medium lime</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, add habaneros, carrots, onion, and garlic cloves. Cover with water and bring to a boil over high heat.

      </li>
      <li>Lower the heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chiles, garlic, carrots and onion to a food processor. Reserve cooking liquid.</li>
      <li>Pulse until combined. Then add 1/4 cup of reserved water (if desired), the vinegar, lime juice, mango and salt. Puree until completely blended, about 1 minute. Add more water to loosen the mixture if the sauce is too thick. I did not add more water as there were plenty of water from the mangos and lime juice and transferred over with the ingredients when taken out of the pan into the food processor.</li>
      <li>Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt, vinegar and/or lime if necessary.</li>
      <li>Transfer the hot sauce to a bottle or jar and keep in refrigerator for up to two weeks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Finished product:</p>
