    <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <li>Peel the potatoes and grate them into a large bowl.

	</li>
      <li>Remove the outer layer and inside of the onion and grate that as well</li>
      <li>Using a colander, your hands to squeeze, paper towels, or any combination you prefer, remove as much of the water from the shredded potatoes and onion. This is important for it to fry well.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, add 2 eggs, 1/3 cup of flour, and salt and pepper. Whisk until everything is combined. This will act as the glue that holds the pancakes together.

      </li>
      <li>Add the egg mixture to the shredded potatoes and onion and mix thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat and fry the pancakes. Each side might take several minutes to reach desired crispness depending on the thickness of the pancake and level of heat.

      </li>
      <li>Let the pancakes rest on paper towels to absorb any excess oil and cool and then serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I like to serve mine with apple sauce and sour cream. I prefer unsweetened apple sauce and I like to add a bit of cinnamon.</p>
    <p>Finished product:</p>
