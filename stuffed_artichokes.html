		<h1>Stuffed Artichokes</h1>
		<p>This recipe makes 2 stuffed artichokes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
      <li>2 artichokes</li>
			<li>1/2 cup bread crumbs (whatever kind you like)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan or Parmesan/Romano cheese</li>
      <li>A few cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 lemon</li>
      <li>1 basil leaf (optional)</li>
		</ul>
    		<h2>Instructions</h2>
    		<ol>
			<li>Start with two medium-sized artichokes (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/6SEnw.jpg">medium sized artichokes - imgur</a>). Trim the tops of them about 3/4 inch or until you can see the center(<a href="https://i.imgur.com/eTFFU.jpg">top view - imgur</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OP6Zd.jpg">top and side view - imgur</a>). My kiwi knives work great for this. Also trim off the stem as they are usually bitter and help clear space in the steamer. Some people leave the pithy center bits inside but some people remove them at this point. If you do remove the center, do not remove the bottom as that is the artichoke heart!</li>
          <li>Rinse the artichokes under cold running water.</li>
          <li>Place the artichokes into your steamer (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/tCZ6g.jpg">in the steamer on sides - also works facing upward if they fit</a>) and start preparing the additional flavoring for the steaming process. I like to add a slice of lemon, some garlic cloves, and a bay leaf (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/iDyND.jpg">steamer and ingredients</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oaudz.jpg">ingredients in steamer</a>). <strong>Note:</strong> <i>Save the halves of lemon on the side of your slice. You will need these later</i>.</li>
			<li>Now you're ready to start steaming. Place them on the stove and bring the water to a boil (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/VUxD9.jpg">everything together on the stove</a>). They should steam for about 20-40 minutes or until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off.</li>
	<li>Mix the breadcrumbs, parmesan, butter, and oil into a bowl. (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/KnYiz.jpg">stuffing mixture in a bowl</a>)</li>
          <li>Once the artichokes have finished steaming, let them cool off for a few minutes and then fill them with the stuffing you prepared (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/LBxxO.jpg">artichokes filled with stuffing between leaves</a>). This is where the lemon halves come back. I like to squeeze the lemon juice over the stuffed artichokes prior to baking them.</li>
          <li>Place the artichokes into an oven that has been preheated to 350Â°F for about 15-20 minutes or until they start to brown.</li>
    		</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gpXNy.jpg">finished product</a> should allow the leaves to be easily pulled off. Scrape the artichoke leaves with teeth to get the vegetable and stuffing. Discard leaves in separate bowl.</p>
