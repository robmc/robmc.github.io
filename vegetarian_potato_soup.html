		<h1>Vegetarian Potato Soup</h1>
		</div>
    <p>This recipe was inspired from <a href="https://bowl-me-over.com/easy-potato-soup-meatlessmonday/">this page</a>. I have not eaten meat intentionally since March 13, 2015 (the date of this posting is 6/20/2019). However I realized recently that there are animal byproducts in places I did not expect such as cheese. Many cheeses list &quot;enzymes&quot; on the label which can either mean plant-based enzymes or animal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet">rennet</a>. When making this recipe, I used cheeses that specifically listed plant-based ingredients to keep the recipe strictly vegetarian. I was able to find the brand <a href="https://www.tillamook.com/cheese/loafs/medium-cheddar.html">Tillamook</a> for the cheddar cheese which was available at Safeway and <a href="https://www.sartoricheese.com/our-cheese/classic-cheese/parmesan.html">Sartori</a> for the parmesan which I found at Whole Foods. Becoming vegetarian has taught me a lot about how the foods we eat are made and what goes into them and I've learned two important things:</p>
	    <ol>
		    <li>You have to pay close attention to labels if trying to adhere to a strict vegetarian diet.</li>
		    <li>You have to have reasonable expecations when eating at restaurants because most places don't have separate grills so there will be a limited amount of meat byproducts in your food. Also, most people eat meat and when someone makes a dish many times the same way, sometimes auto pilot kicks in so it's always good to check your food to make sure there's no meat in it.</li>
	    </ol>
    <p>That said, I ate cheese for several years thinking it was vegetarian. I'm also not vegan so I'm ok with enjoying cheese. For this recipe, however, I wanted to adhere to a strict vegetarian recipe and the original link I found did not mention that cheeses are not strictly vegetarian unless you ensure there are no animal products in them.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
      <li>6-8 cups russet potatoes peeled and chopped (3-4 large potatoes)</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion peeled and diced</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>4 cups vegetable stock</li>
      <li>2 cups cheddar cheese shredded</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese shredded</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sour cream or cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>Scallions (for garnish)</li>
	</ul>

	  </div>
      </li>
      <li>Heat a large pot on the stove over medium heat add the butter & olive oil then add the onions & celery. Season with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.</li>
      <li>Peel and dice the potatoes. Add the potatoes and minced garlic to the pot and continue to saut√© all of the ingredients for about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the vegetable stock and increase the heat to high. Bring to a boil, stirring quite often. This will release the starch in the potatoes and help thicken the soup. Depending on the size of the dice of the potatoes it will take 14-18 minutes. Cook the potatoes until they are fork tender. The stew will be quite thick.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and stir in both cheeses and the sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Finished product:</p>
